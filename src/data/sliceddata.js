The remaining portions of Lord Shiva appeared at four other places and are worshipped there as his manifestations. The arms of the Lord appeared at Tungnath, the face at Rudranath, the belly at Madmaheshwar and his locks (hair) at Kalpeshwar. The Kedarnath and four above mentioned shrines make the revered Panch Kedar pilgrimage circuit.",

Once approved, 250 builders were hired to build the monument, which took over two years to finish. Initially, the Eiffel Tower was the subject of controversy. The artists of the period thought the monument to be monstrous, and given its poor profitability, it was suggested on several occasions that they should demolish it.During World War I, enemy messages were intercepted thanks to the tower radiotelegraphy center.Currently, the Eiffel Tower is the most-visited monument in the world with over 7 million visitors a year. This is partly due to the popularity of Paris as a tourist destination.",
